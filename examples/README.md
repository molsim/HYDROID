# HYDROID: Usage examples
The esiest way to get familiar with HYDROID is to follow one of the well documented step-by-step examples and modify them as needed for the user data:

* [Example 1](../examples/example1): Quantifying HRF of a centromeric nucleosome with DNA radioactively labeled at 3' end. Predicting cleavage frequency profiles from an atomistic structure model and comparing to experimental ones.
* [Example 2](../examples/example2): Quantifying HRF of a nucleosome with DNA radioactively labeled at 5' end. Highlights conversion of gel images to data profiles via ImageJ.
