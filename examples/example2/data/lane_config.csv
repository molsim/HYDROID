#Example 2: Lane profile configuration file for profiles stored in lane_profiles.xls as extracted by ImageJ from gel electrophoresis image file.
#Note: most of these parameters should be set in an interactive manner using assign_peak_interactive function.
#
#column - name of column with an array of profile values in lane_profile.xls
#lanme - arbitrary name of the gel lane (e.g. experiment label).
#leftlim, rightlim - indexes of values in profile array that specify the datarange that will be analyzed, in NaN dataset is not truncated
#peakthresh - parameter for automatic peak identification algorithm, use lower values to identify more subtle peaks. However, this may lead to false positives.
#min_dist_left - minimal distance between the individual peaks allowed at the left side of the data range.
#min_dist_right - minimal distance between the individual peaks allowed at the right side of the data range.
#segments - number of segment the data range is split into for linear interpolation of the min_dist value for the automatic peak identification algorithm.
#base - try to substract linear baseline from the profile before peak identification attempt.
#interpolate - try to guess the location of unidentified peaks from the local average spacing betwee the nearby peaks.
#alignpos - the index of position in the profile array used to align all the profiles if they are to be plotted simultaneously (i.e. to overlay Maxam-Gilbert profiles with OH-radical profiles), end - means use the last datapoint in the profile.
#seqpeak - approximate position of the peak that corresponds to a particular postion on DNA sequence specified by seqpos
#seqpos - position on DNA sequence that is attributed to a particular peak identified by seqpeak value.
#addpeaks - a list of peak positions to add manually to those identified automatically by the algorithm, format - values separated by spaces.
#delpeaks - a list of peak positions to be deleted manually to those identified automatically by the algorithm, format - values separaed by spaces.
## if any of the parameter values may be omitted or set to NaN, default gess values will be used.
##If multiple lines with the same lname are present the last one will be read.
