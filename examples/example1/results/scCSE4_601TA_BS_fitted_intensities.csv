#Data column description
#Intensity - total deconvoluted intensity of each band (coefficient before Gaussian or Lorentzian function,area under the individual Gaussian/Lorentzian curve)
#Site - DNA site corresponding to the band (cleaved site)
#area_dev_percent - % difference in area under each peak between fitted curve and original data (the segment used to calculate are for each peak starts and ends at the midpoints between the neighboring peaks)
#sigma or gamma_2 - the width parameter of the functions modeling each band, sgima if Gaussain ,gamma/2 if Lorentzian
#x_0 - position of the Gaussian/Lorentzian modeling each band on the original profile
