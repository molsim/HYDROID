HYDROID (HYDroxyl-Radical fOotprinting Interpretation for DNA)
Example 1, centromeric nucleosome of yeast reconstituted on a well-positioning sequence, Shaytan et al. 2017

HYDROIDexp, Step 3:
Calling peaks (assigning DNA sequence positions to individual peaks)

Peak calling is usually accomplished by comparing footprinting lanes to sequencing lanes or other data.

In this step the user is allowed to compare Maxam-Guilbert and HRF profiles on same plots
and to interactively specify the location of any band peak on the DNA sequence.
Sequence calling for all other peaks will be done automatically.

The data is saved to data/lane_config.csv by pressing the Save button.
It is advised to check data/lane_config.csv afterwards,
any saved records will be written at the end of the file and override any previous records.
