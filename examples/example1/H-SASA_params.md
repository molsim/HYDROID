# Analysis of H-SASA profiles dependence of various parameters.

DNA cleavage by hydroxyl-radicals is accomplished through abstraction of deoxyribose hydrogen atoms. Hence their solvent accessible surface area (H-SASA) can be used as a proxy to estimate the probability of cleavage given a PDB structure.

However, H-SASA depends on a number of parameters (structure quality and conformation, probe radius, choice of atomic radii set). Below we provide an analysis of the influence of these parameters on the H-SASA profiles in nucleosome.
# Structure choice
Structures with hydrogen atoms added in a variety of ways were considered:
- [scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_Ndist.pdb](data/structures/scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_Ndist.pdb) was generated by [REDUCE](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php) program as provided in [AmberTools17](http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools) with following command:
`reduce -NUClear scCSE4_601TA_nucl.pdb > scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_Ndist.pdb`
The -NUClear option instucts to use nuclear X-H distances (~1.09 A for sugars) rather than default electron cloud distances (~0.97A).
- [scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_ELdist.pdb](data/structures/scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_ELdist.pdb) was generated by [REDUCE](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php) program as provided in [AmberTools17](http://ambermd.org/#AmberTools) with following command:
`reduce scCSE4_601TA_nucl.pdb > scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_Ndist.pdb`
The default electron cloud distances of ~0.97A for X-H bonds in sugars are used.
- [scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_MD1ns.pdb](data/structures/scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_MD1ns.pdb) generated by [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) psfgen command with CHARMM36 force field and then simulated using molecular dynamics simulations for 1 ns in explicit solvent using [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/).
- [scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_MD2ns.pdb](data/structures/scCSE4_601TA_nucl_H_MD2ns.pdb) - previous structure after simulations for 2 nanoseconds.
- [../exampleMD](../exampleMD) - provides 50 frames from a molecular dyanmics trajectory, which are used to calculate averaged profiles.

# Calculating H-SASA profiles with different parameters.
- [H-SASA_params_scan.py](H-SASA_params_scan.py) implements calculation of H-SASA profiles for the above listed structures with a number of different parameters by varying atomic van-der-Waals radii sets (default in FreeSASA, AMBER12 force field, CHARMM36 force field), probe radius used to build the surface (from 1 A to 5 A). SASA values for the following atoms are calculated separately allowing to assess their contributions: H1', H2'+H2'', H3', H4', H5'+H5''.

# Analysis of the results
- [H-SASA_params_analyze.py](H-SASA_params_analyze.py) and [H-SASA_params_analyze_vs_Exp.py] were used to generate interactive plots:
    - [nucl_H-SASA.html](https://ncbi.github.io/HYDROID/example1/results/nucl_H-SASA.html) shows top and bottom strand H-SASA profiles depending on various paramters.
    - [nucl_H-SASAvsEXP_TS.html](https://ncbi.github.io/HYDROID/example1/results/nucl_H-SASAvsEXP_TS.html) and [nucl_H-SASAvsEXP_BS.html](https://ncbi.github.io/HYDROID/example1/results/nucl_H-SASAvsEXP_BS.html) show comparison of experimetnal profiles to H-SASA profiles generated with different parameters.
