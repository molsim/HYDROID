Example 1, centromeric nucleosome of yeast reconstituted on a well-positioning sequence, Shaytan et al. 2017

HYDROIDexp, Step 2:
assigning initial peaks positions to gel band peaks on 1-D lane profiles

The automatic peak identification algorithm is guided by parameters set in data/lane_config.csv
(see inside this file for a list of parameters and their descriptions).

For a new project the data/lane_config.csv should be modified to reflect the number of data columns (and set their names)
in the lane profile data file generated by ImageJ (data/lane_profiles.xls).

HYDROIDexp functions triggered by this stript open up a graphical window and allow for an interactive manual adjustment of the majority of
these paramters and saving them back to file (press Save button).
Positions of the band peaks identified by the semi-automatic algorithm are maked by asterisks and change interactively
upon adjustments of the algorithm paramters in the GUI window.

As a result of this step it is important to make sure that every peak in the region of interest of
HRF lane profiles (specified by leftlim an rightlim paramters) is maked by exactly one asterisk.

For the Maxam-Gilbert lanes exact identification of peaks is not important,
however, this step helps to set the alignpos parameter - a characteristic position on a profile that
will be used in the next step to align HRF and Maxam-Gilbert profiles for sequence calling.

It is advised to check data/lane_config.csv afterwards,
any saved parameter records will be written at the end of the file and override any previous records.

# Parameters of the automatic peak identification should be interactively adjusted
