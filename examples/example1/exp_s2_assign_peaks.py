HYDROIDexp, Step 2:
assigning initial peaks positions to gel band peaks on 1-D lane profiles

The automatic peak identification algorithm is guided by parameters set in data/lane_config.csv
(see inside for a list of parameters).
HYDROIDexp functions triggered by this stript allow for interactive manual adjustment of the majority of
these paramters and saving them back to file (press Save button).
Positions of band peaks identified by the semi-automatic algorithm are maked by asterisks and change interactively
upon adjustments of the algorithm paramters.

As a result of this step it is important to make sure that every peak in the region of interest of
HRF lane profiles (specified by leftlim an rightlim paramters) is maked by exactly on asterisk.

For the Maxam-Guilbert lanes exact identification of peaks is not important,
however, this step helps to set the alignpos parameter - a characteristic position on a profile that
will be used in the next step to align HRF and Maxam-Guilbert profiles for sequence calling.

It is advised to check data/lane_config.csv afterwards,
any saved records will be written at the end of the file and override any previous records.

# Parameters of the automatic peak identification should be interactively adjusted
