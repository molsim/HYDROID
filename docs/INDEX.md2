# HYDROID
HYDROID (HYDroxyl-Radical fOotprinting Interpretation for DNA) is a python package for the analysis of experimental data generated by hydroxyl-radical footprinting (HRF) of DNA-protein complexes.

## Workflow

This package has two python libraries implementing complementary functionalities:
* [HYDROIDexp.py](HYDROIDexp.py) - extraction of DNA cleavage frequency profiles from gel electrophoresis images.
* [HYDROIDpred.py](HYDROIDpred.py) - estimation of theoretical DNA cleavage frequency profiles from PDB structures through estimating deoxyribose hydrogen atoms solvent accessibility (H-SASA).

## Documentation
Several step-by-step examples serve as a manual to the package.
* [Example 1](example1): Quantifying HRF of a centromeric nucleosome with DNA radioactively labeled at 3' end. Predicting cleavage frequency profiles from an atomistic structure model and comparing to experimental ones.
* [Example 2](example2): Quantifying HRF of a nucleosome with DNA radioactively labeled at 5' end. Highlights conversion of gel images to data profiles via ImageJ.

DocString documentation for every function is provided inside the libraries and step-by-step example python files.

Detailed information about HYDROID algorithms can be found in the accompanying publication: A.K. Shaytan et al. (in preparation)


## Installation

Latest stable version of HYDROID can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/ncbi/HYDROID/releases).
The name of the directory containing the contents of the package should always be `HYDROID`.

### Requirements
- Python 2.7
- Python modules specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). 
- [freesasa library](http://freesasa.github.io) v2.0.1 should be compiled with python bindings and accessible in python (only needed for HYDROIDpred).

### Installation examples

Installing Python and its modules is usually system specific. Using `virtualenv` together with `pip` or other python package managers to match the exact versions of the modules is recommended. We provide environment files for `pip` ([requirements.txt](requirements.txt)) and Continuum Anaconda ([conda_env.yml](conda_env.yml)).

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) provides common installation examples for Linux, MacOS and PC.

## Further information

HYDROID is intended to help in quantification of hydroxyl-radical footprinting experiments of protein-DNA complexes (or free DNA) and comparison of these data to available structural models.

Hydroxyl-radical footprinting is one of [DNA footprinting methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_footprinting).

For the initial familiarization with hydroxyl-radical footprinting techniques and theory following references and references therein are suggested:
